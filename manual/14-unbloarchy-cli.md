# Unbloarchy CLI

Unbloarchy is usually controlled through the hotkeys and the Unbloarchy menu (`Super + Space`). But you can also control it through the `unbloarchy` CLI. This is particularly helpful when you're having an AI agent work with you on customization or configuration.

The CLI has access to all the internal tooling that is used both via the menu and otherwise. You can see everything that's available by running `unbloarchy` in the terminal.

It looks something like this:

```

Every command takes `--help` too, whether you ask a whole group (`unbloarchy capture --help`) or a single command (`unbloarchy capture screenshot --help`).

### Opening the menu from the terminal

The Unbloarchy menu is scriptable as well, which is handy for your own keybindings. `unbloarchy menu` opens it at the root, and you can jump straight to any point in the tree by naming it: `unbloarchy menu summon style.theme` goes right to the theme picker, `unbloarchy menu toggle system` opens the system menu and closes it again if it's already up, and `unbloarchy menu close` puts it away.
